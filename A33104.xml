            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE greateſt Glory of Man, and the loweſt, and yet the moſt loving and lovely ſtep of <hi>GODS Condeſcenſion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man, was, is, and ſhall be, that he is admitted into a Covenant Relation with GOD, whereby the Lord becomes his GOD, King, Maſter, Husband, Father; And he becomes the Lords peculiar Subject, Servant, Friend and Son. It would have been preſumption in Man to offer this to GOD, Covenants ſuppoſing properly equality, freedom from pre-obligations, and Independency between the Parties Covenanting; None of which were, or could be in Covenant-Tranſactions between GOD and Man, but Infinite diſtance and Diſproportion; Abſolute Subjection, Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Dependance on Mans part, under the Dominion and Law of his <hi>Creator,</hi> from under which, and without which, it is impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he could have a Beeing. But, as it was an Act of Grace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion in GOD, to make Man after His own Image, in perfection of Holineſs; So it was an Act of Condeſcenſion to illuminate this with the luſter of a perfect Law, given for his Rule: Unto this it is a great additament of Condeſcenſion, that He ſhould give any promiſes encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging to Obedience: And greater, to conceive theſe confirmed by an Oath. But that the Lord ſhould offer to Covenant with Man, and to give the Law. Promiſes and Oath Covenant-wayes, is a greater wonder of Condeſcenſion: This being a greater priviledge, as well as ſecurity, than either Law, Promiſes or Oaths. This was a wonderful act of Grace and Condeſcenſion to Man at firſt, or the firſt Man repreſenting all Mankind, to propoſe to him, and to take him under the bond of the Covenant of Works: But after the violation of that firſt Covenant, that there ſhould be any acceſs granted to any of the Children of Men, to the benefit of a ſecond Tranſaction of Grace, is a wonder of Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion never enough conſidered. The firſt was the honour and happineſs of the firſt Man, propoſed for the benefit, and being violate, became the Shame and Curſe of all Men. The ſecond is the honour and happineſs,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108660:3"/> in and through CHRIST, common and peculiar to all the Elect, the Objects of the <hi>Covenant of Redemption,</hi> of which that of Grace is an exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Tranſumpt. This being the main difference between the <hi>Eternal Covenant of Redemption</hi> between the Father and the Son, and the <hi>Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant of Grace,</hi> made alſo with CHRIST principally as Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of His Heirs of Grace and Glory, that in the former, CHRIST our Sponſor is to be conſidered, as the Son and ſecond Perſon of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> Co-equal and Co-eſſential with the Father, tranſacting about His Mediatory Delegation in the buſſineſs of Redemption; in the later He is to be conſidered as the Mediator, the Fathers Servant and Delegate. In the former the Promiſes are made conditionally to CHRIST, upon condition of His ſatisfying Juſtice in the fulneſs of time, and abſolutly to the Elect, without reſpect to any thing foreſeen in them; in the later they are made abſolutly to Chriſt, now having fulfilled his undertaking, and conditionally, or by way of Teſtamentary diſpoſition to the Elect. But as GODS making Covenant with Man is a wonder of never enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Condeſcendency; ſo His admitting Men to make a Covenant with him, is no leſs matter of Admiration. Yet this he hath not only offered and allowed, but perſwaded unto it by Commands, Promiſes, Threatnings, Arguments, Expoſtulations, Invitations and Intreaties in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament: Where we find Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with GOD, both Perſonal and National, hath the ſanction of Divine Approbation. For Perſonal Covenanting with GOD, it may be proven by Scripture Precepts, Promiſes, and Practiſes of the Saints. All theſe Commands and Calls given to come and buy the Covenants Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits (which ſuppoſes a <hi>Bargain</hi>) to come to the Marriage <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inferring a conſent to the Terms of a conjugal Covenant, do prove it to be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Duty. All theſe Promiſes of ſubſcribing with the hand unto the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.5. That they ſhall call the Lord their Father, and not turn from Him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. That they ſhall call him <hi>Iſhi,</hi> and no more <hi>Baali, Hoſ.</hi> 2.16. That he ſhall ſay <hi>It is my People,</hi> and they ſhall ſay <hi>The Lord is my GOD. Zech.</hi> 13.9. do clearly imply and infer this. There are alſo Precedents and Examples of the Saints confirming this, ſuch as <hi>Jacobs</hi> Vow, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20 to the end, <hi>Davids, Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 57, 106. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.2.5. and many others. Upon this ground they took confidence to lay particular claim to the Lord as their own GOD, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Portion.</p>
            <p>But our purpoſe at preſent is to ſpeak of <hi>National Covenanting.</hi> For clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and vindicating which, it will not be unprofitable to conſider what

It is altogether beſide the purpoſe: For the Magiſtrate is neither the Father nor Husband of the Church, thô in ſome ſenſe <hi>to</hi> the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.23. having a power as a <hi>nurſing</hi> Father, not as a <hi>generating</hi> Father, <hi>Comulative</hi> not <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative:</hi> Nor hath he ſuch power over his Subjects, as a Father over his Child, or Husband over his Wife. Certainly theſe heads of Tribes <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. were Politick Fathers, as Magiſtrates; yet it is not allowed to them to Diſanul, Vacate, or make void theſe Vows, but to the Father or Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the Party making them, from whom, theſe heads of Tribes are ſpoken to, as diſtinct; and the command is given to theſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats only to ſee it obſerved and ratified. Again, National Covenants for Religious Ends and Intereſts, are not to be ſuppoſed of that nature of theſe Vows, which were not about neceſſary, but indifferent things, and it ſeems raſhly and unadviſedly engaged into; for the Father had no power to make null, or of no effect, the Maids engagements to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and indiſpenſable Duties. And as to theſe things which he might diſallow and diſanul, it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſhall forgive her,</hi> intimating there was ſomething iniquous in it. However, as the Father holding his Peace, did ratifie the Vow. <hi>verſe</hi> 4, and was not to reſcind it afterwards, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. So this <hi>Achillean</hi> Argument of the Prelatical and Malignant Party, againſt our Covenants, adduced from this place, hath no Nerves; becauſe the Father, as they ſenſe it, or the Magiſtrate held his peace at, and gave his conſent to the Renewing both the National Covenant, and Solemn League and Covenant, thô afterwards he made Inquiries, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25. and reſcinded it, by an audacious Heaven-dating Law.

            <p n="3">3. Inclinations to Idolatry of any ſort, <hi>To go and ſerve the gods of theſe Nations.</hi> ver. 18. Idolatry is a breach of Covenant, and inclination to it does eaſily inſnare in the guilt of it. Where a man begins once whoriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look after idols of any kind; he is readily and righteouſly left to follow his look. Not only is it Idolatry to worſhip Wood and Stone, Silver and Gold, but to give Gods due to any other Object (contrair to the 1ſt: <hi>Command;</hi>) And to worſhip Him any other way then he hath commanded (contrair to the 2d: <hi>Command;</hi>) There are many <hi>heart idols,</hi> as <hi>Self,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> being Idolatry. There are many <hi>land-idols</hi> of jealouſie, as when any wicked <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Courſe</hi> is ſet up, in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with, and oppoſition to, and complied with in prejudice of Chriſts Intereſt and Cauſe. Thus in this Land, the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Eraſtianſime, Prelacy, Supremacy,</hi> and <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> aſcribing to Kings of Clay, what is the incommunicable Prerogative of the Prince of the Kings of the earth, and Peoples <hi>love of the World, ſelf peace, eaſe, liberty,</hi> &amp;c. Incomplyance with theſe Intereſts, have been the <hi>Idols of theſe Nations:</hi> And their heart turning away from the Lord to theſe, have led them to forſake the Covenant.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hereupon follows <hi>the root that beareth Gall and Worm-wood, ver.</hi> 18. which is a bribed, blinded, or ſeared Conſcience, or <hi>an evil heart of unbelief

When the heart turns away from God, then it inclines to Idols: when it is ſo bewitched, then the Conſcience, that is firſt Reclamant, gets a bribe from the perverted will and affections to hold its peace at, and to excuſe ſin, and then its dictats are <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Worm-wood,</hi> being blinded with Error, it ſeeks ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to juſtify the ſinful Practice, and at length is ſo ſeated, that it is proof againſt all reproof, and wholly benummed with the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin under the energy of ſtrong deluſions, which are bitter in the end. This hath been the fourth ſtep leading in breach of Covenant in <hi>Scotland;</hi> when firſt the Tentation was preſented, of bowing to theſe Idols of jealouſie above mentioned, and the <hi>Queſtion</hi> ſtated, ſhall we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or Renounce the Covenant?

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108660:14"/> with Judgements, that are publick and National. 3.

It may be, if Repentance prevent it not, as we have been a hiſſing and a taunting proverb, for the guilt of it, ſo we may be a curſe and execration, for the puniſhment of it.</p>

                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26:</note> 
               <hi>and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped them.</hi> Indeed this is the groſſeſt way of breaking Covenant, to ſerve and worſhip other Gods: But this hath alſo its degrees, whether this Idolatry be conſidered as a breach of the Firſt, or of the Second Commandment, as was ſhewed before, and undeniable in the Scriptures. There is external and internal Idolatry. There is Idolatry that hath a wrong object, and Idolatry alſo that may pretend the true object of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but conſiſting in a worſhip not of His appointment. However, by the way it may be noted, that <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> is all one. Hence the <hi>Popiſh</hi> diſtinction of <hi>Dowleia</hi> and <hi>Latreia</hi> is groundleſs and Anti-ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. This <hi>Serving</hi> or <hi>Worſhiping</hi> of other gods, is aggravated from two grounds. [1] They were <hi>gods whom they knew not,</hi> worſhiping <hi>an unknown god</hi> (according to the <hi>Motto</hi> of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Alter) is a peculiar ſtretch of of Idolatrous ſuperſtition, <hi>Act.</hi> 17:22, 23: Ignorance then (of the object, or of the way of worſhip) is not the <hi>Mother</hi> but the <hi>Murther</hi> of true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. The Introduction of any unknown or uncouth thing, whether it be in the object, or manner of worſhip, or any New Invention, or Innovation in the ſervice or worſhip of God, is hence inferred to be a breach of Covenant.

               <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Liad our God: but thoſe things which are revealed belong unto us, and to our Children for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law.</hi> This may be taken either abſtractly, as an Apothegm by it ſelf, or with relation to what follows in the next <hi>chapter,</hi> or to what preceeds in <hi>this.</hi> Sin and Duty is here clearly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that ſhould be the matter of our exerciſe: But Events are ſecrets belonging to the Lord.

            <p>THeſe being premiſed there is the leſs need to inlarge in the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Renovation</hi> of theſe Covenants, here ſubjoyned, as they were <hi>Sworn</hi> and <hi>Subſcribed</hi> at <hi>Leſmahego.</hi> March, 3. 1689. Their <hi>Motives</hi> are before touched on <hi>Queſtion</hi> 4. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. to 9. They Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what the Lord had done before their eyes, the great tentations in their day, the ſigns and the great wonders of the Wiſdom, Faithfulneſs, Power, Juſtice and Goodneſs of the Lord, appearing in His way with them and their Fathers. They Conſidered the univerſal Obduration, Stupidity, and unanſwerableneſs to theſe wonders in themſelves and others, how they had not gotten hearts to perceive, nor eyes to ſee in to that very day. They Conſidered the Lords greacious Conduct of them and their fathers, and their own experience of His care and kindneſs towards them, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding ſo tenderly and wonderfully all neceſſaries for their <hi>Wilderneſs Lot.</hi> They conſidered, how at length the Lord helped them to overcome two Kings, that endeavoured by all means to deſtroy them. They conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that, as the Lord promiſes proſperity to the keeping, and doing the words of His Covenant; So, in the dayes of their Fathers, when they entered into, and kept Covenant with God, He proſpered them in all that they undertook, went forth with their Armies, and made their Enemies to fall down before them, teſtifying in His providence His approbation of His peoples Covenanting. They conſidered alſo, how theſe Covenants (thô of Eternal obligation, as is cleared <hi>Queſt.</hi> 14. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.) were broken, their breaches enacted by Law, <hi>they were Burnt,</hi> the owning of them declared Criminal by an Act of <hi>Queensberries</hi> Parliament, and the obligation of them, was like to be totally buried in oblivion. And therefore, as they thought this a <hi>Caſe of Confeſſion,</hi> when they could do no more, to give their Teſtimony for the Covenants, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Sorrow of their hearts, and abhorrence of their ſouls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe indignities (as was done in the Printed <hi>Teſtimony, anno.</hi> 1688.) So, upon the ſame motives, they thought it no leſs neceſſary, now, in this opportunity, to revive the memory of them, and at leaſt to break the ice for others to renew them more Solemnly. At that Critical ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, eſpecially, when in the univerſal expectation of War, upon the change of the Government, all parties were Aſſociating for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and aſſerting the quarrell and party they would eſpouſe: They alſo thought it expedient, by the renewing of theſe ancient Covenants,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108660:18"/> declare what Cauſe they would avouch, and appear for; what King they would owne, and upon what termes they would offer, and oblige their ſubjection to the preſent Government, then to be eſtabliſhed, who had before declared a revolt from the former, and for this end, to make this the bond of their Aſſociation.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>objected,</hi> With a great deal of clamour by many, that this was an illegal and preſumptuous Action, without all Authority, or concurrence of perſons that had Authority to tender an Oath. But as this is looſed by what is ſaid above, on <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3, and <hi>Q.</hi> 7. from <hi>v.</hi> 1. and <hi>v.</hi> 10. So we have precedents for entering into, and renewing Covenants, for Defence of Religion and Liberty, without the Authority then regnant, in ſeveral inſtances before, and ſince the eſtabliſhed Reformation; As that Covenant at <hi>Edinburgh, anno</hi> 1557, for the maintenance and advancement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and defence of one another adhering to it. Another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at <hi>Perth,</hi> 1559. And at <hi>Stirling,</hi> the ſame year. Another at <hi>Leith, anno</hi> 1560. Another at <hi>Air,</hi> 1562. All theſe without the concurrence of publick Authority. And in the year 1638, the National Covenant was Renewed before they obtained Authority for it. And <hi>anno</hi> 1666. at <hi>Lanerk,</hi> a ſmall handful of honneſt and faithful patriots renewed the Solemn League alſo, without and againſt the Authority that was then. But this at <hi>Leſmahego,</hi> thô it was without Authority, yet it was not againſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, being in the time of the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> before the ſettlement of <hi>Authority,</hi> for which <hi>Cauſe,</hi> in ſtead of the uſual Expreſſions of <hi>the King,</hi> &amp; <hi>his Majeſty,</hi> they read as in the margent, <hi>His Highneſs,</hi> or <hi>the Civil Magiſtrate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the preſent K: was not then declared. And that party who renewed the <hi>Covenants</hi> then did not pretend to any Authority to do it as a <hi>National Act,</hi> to bind the whoſe Nation; Only to take on the vowes of God upon themſelves, and to invite others to do the like. If thoſe that tendered the Covenant at that time, did take upon them any Authority, it was not to impoſe it upon any, but rather to exclude ſome from it, and to hinder their admiſſion to it, who were groſsly ignorant and ſcandalous, by laying out before them the hazard of ſwearing falſely. And diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging them, in the name of the Lord, to devour theſe holy things. This alſo was an Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nce to ſome and occaſion of obloquie againſt the Action: But it is juſtifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d above, by what is ſaid on <hi>Queſt.</hi> 11. from <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by an Act of Aſſembly, <hi>July</hi> 20. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 19. <hi>anno</hi> 1649. <q>Debarring groſs Complyers from the Covenant, and Ordaining that none of thoſe who were debarred, ſhould be admitted, but ſuch as after exact trial, ſhould be found for ſome Competent time, before or after the offer of their Repentance, to have in their ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108660:19"/> given Teſtimony of their diſlike of theſe Complyances.</q> And it is not to be forgotten, when the Miniſter was enlarging on the ſins of ſuch as had voluntarly given in the ſame to him, with their names, in Write, beforehand (<hi>viz.</hi> ſome that had gone a great length in Sinful and Scandalous exceſſes, with that Impoſtor <hi>John Gibb,</hi> and many others who had been involved in ſeveral ſad defections, in the late defiling times, as, Hearing the <hi>Curats,</hi> paying the <hi>Ceſs,</hi> taking the Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> &amp;c.) Offering, and deſiring to make publick Acknowledgment before the Congregation (then in the <hi>Fields</hi>) of theſe their publick ſin; Not only ſeveral others, who had not given up their names, roſe up, and openly declared that they were guilty of ſeveral ſteps of defection; but alſo ſome declared their guilt of perſonal Scandals; till at length the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter was neceſſitate ſeveral times to crave forbearance, the day being ſo far ſpent, that (after the Covenants were ſworn) the ſubſcribing of them was hereby (happily) prevented untill night, which was done in the <hi>Church.</hi> The great out cry is againſt the Alterations and additions in this Renovation of the Covenants: But as this objection is taken off by what is ſaid above on <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. from <hi>verſe</hi> 1. So, that Renovation of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Covenant, in the year 1638, With very large additions accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to the time, is a precedent juſtifying any Alterations or Additions in the Covenant Renewed at <hi>Leſmabego,</hi> which are only in theſe words of the Covenants, that cannot ſuit the preſent times, as is obvious from every Alteration, marked only in the Margent, without expunging the old words.</p>
            <p>There are indeed many Additions in the <hi>Acknowledgment of ſins</hi> and <hi>Engagement to duties</hi> (which alſo were then Solemnly Renewed) becauſe theſe Late unhappy times of defection have produced many other ſins, than could be Confeſſed in that Acknowledgment, <hi>Anno</hi> 1649. But the whole of the former is retained in a <hi>Large Character;</hi> And the Additions ſubjoyned in a <hi>Leſſer Character,</hi> for diſtinction; The ſame is done, upon the ſame grounds, in the Engagement to duties annexed. In the <hi>former,</hi> the ſins of the time are acknowledged impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, without concealing any of their own, ſo far as they had light, no more than the ſins of any other party. In the <hi>Latter,</hi> the duties of the Covenant are particularly and plainly engaged into, according to their Conſcience of them, even thoſe that are, or have been Controverted: That if others may not hereby be excited to conſider them; Yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might come to, and intertain a determined ſenſe of them, and not halt between two opinions. And to the end the Material and Moral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the Covenants may be conſidered and diſcovered, to wit,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108660:19"/> that the duties thereof are antecedently Commanded, and the ſins there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of antecedently forbidden, thô there had been no ſuperadded Covenant; Therefore, in the Acknowledgment of ſins (according to the Order of the Articles of the Covenant, which are there repeated) the Scriptures confirming every Article and Clauſe thereof, are annexed.</p>
            <p>Finally, The <hi>Objection</hi> which is moſt commonly inſiſted on, and ſeems to have moſt weight, is, That thô it were tolerable to Renew the <hi>National</hi> Covenant; Yet, for a party in <hi>Scotland</hi> to renew the <hi>Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> is folly and preſumption, without their concurrence and conſent, a League without Colleagues being abſurd and ridiculous. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This indeed were a very thorny point, if it were pleaded or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> was, or is to be Renewed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a party, or the whole body of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, under the ſame and adequate formality, conſideration, and extent of Aſſociation and Confederation with <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> as it was at its firſt framing; that is, as a League Offenſive and Defenſive with the Collective body of theſe Kingdoms, and the Noblemen, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, Burgeſſes, Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and Commons of all ſorts, in <hi>Scotland, England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> For that would involve in an Aſſociation with the Prelatical and Malignant party. In regard of which, as the caſe now ſtands, it were very hard to Renew that League for Religion, between theſe Nations, albeit their concurrence and conſent were obtained, for fear of a ſinful Aſſociation, ſo much Condemned in Scripture, except they were more Reformed, and better diſpoſed for Reformation, and except the things to be Reformed in both, were more particularly expreſſed, with accommodation to the ſeveral c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rruptions of theſe times; that were not known, and could not be foreſeen, at the firſt making of the <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant:</hi> But it is not abſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, that the whole Nation, or even a party in it, renew That Holy Engagement, as it is a <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>God:</hi> wherein He is reſpected not only as witneſs, but <hi>Party Contracting,</hi> or with whom they Contract, and to whom they vow obedienee: Wherein alſo, they oblige themſelves to nothing, either with reference to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> or thoſe that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were <hi>Colleagues,</hi> now broken off from the <hi>League,</hi> but what they are bound to antecedently, if there had never been any ſuch <hi>Covenant,</hi> or <hi>League,</hi> or <hi>Colleagues.</hi> And if it be Conſidered as a <hi>League</hi> or Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; It is Renewed, not in the ſame extent as formerly, but only with thoſe that did then renew it, or with all that owne it in <hi>Scotland, England</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> Upon this Conſideration, theſe words in the begining of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108660:20"/> 
               <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> expreſſing the ſeveral ranks, and the extent of the Covenanters were not read, at the Renewing of it at <hi>Leſmabego.</hi> Becauſe they owned themſelves to be under a League with none, but ſuch as owned the Covenanted Reformation. Nor is it altogether unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented, that a Nation Renewing the Covenant, from which their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues have receded. The Renovation of it in <hi>Scotland, anno</hi> 1649. was, after the prevailing power of <hi>England</hi> did reſile from their Engagements; thô ſome did then, as to this day a few do adhere to them. All the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were once in Covenant together: The revolt of the Ten Tribes, did not hinder the Godly in <hi>Judah</hi> to renew it, in the dayes of <hi>Aſa, Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> nor did it preclude a ſmal party of <hi>Ephraim Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,</hi> &amp;c. to take part in it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.9, 12. But thô there might be ſome informality or inconveniency in keeping the old Form of the <hi>Solemn League,</hi> with ſuch alterations only annoted on the <hi>Margent,</hi> as might make it accommodable to the preſent time: And perhaps it had been more ſuitable, to frame it altogether in a New Form, if the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of Church and State had concurred: Yet, that party at <hi>Leſmahe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> not daring to take ſo much upon them, and therefore adhering to both Matter and Form, ſo far as it could ſerve the time, and the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof quadrate with their capacities, are not to be raſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for their Renewing old Vows, which were (and in ſo far only as they were) before, and then, and are alwayes binding. Yea rather it were ſuitable and ſeaſonable for the Repreſentatives (who can eaſily mend, what was not within their ſphere to do) in ſtead of deſpiſing the meanneſs of that party, and carping at the imperfections of that action, to imitate their Zeal, in Renewing theſe National Engagements, with ſolemn Acknowledgements of the Breaches thereof, in a Form that will better pleaſe them. This would be a notable mean of turning away the Lords fierce Wrath from the Nation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.10. Hereby Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Church and State might be promoted and preſerved; Order <hi>and Union in the Church, which hath been long wanting, might be ſettled and eſtabliſhed; Former Defections might be honeſtly and honourably removed and remedied; Future In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations and Corruptions, Schiſmes and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How pleaſant and acceptable, both to God and Man, would it be, as it may be hoped it will be, when the Lords people in theſe Lands, now ſore and long ſcattered and divided, ſhall return going and weeping, ſeeking the Lord their God, and asking the way to <hi>Zion</hi> with their Faces thitherward, That, at leaſt the Owners &amp; Lovers of Reformation, were ſaying, Come and let us joyn our ſelves unto the Lord, in a perpetual <hi>Covenant,</hi> that ſhall not be forgotten.</hi>

And after our Fathers in their Solemn Acknowledgement of Sins, and Engagement to Duties, had confeſſed the guilt of that Malignant Aſſociation, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108660:27"/> obliged themſelves for the future, never any more to connive at, comply with, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Malignancy; Yet they joyned themſelves again with the people of theſe abominations: And upon terms deſtructive to the Nations and Churches Intereſt, diſhonourable to God, and prejudicial to Poſterity, accepted their mock Repentance, and admitted Malignants to places of Power and Truſt: And by a precipitant Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> with the head of them <hi>Charles</hi> II. brought him over and made him King, upon his mock-ſubſcription of the Covenant, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had given manifeſt diſcoveries of his Treachery and Enmity to Religion and Liberty, in his Commiſſionating <hi>James Graham,</hi> to invade this Kingdom, in the mean time of the Treaty; Whereby GOD was mocked, his Church cheated, and the State betrayed.

For which breaches of Covenant, the anger of the LORD was evidently ſeen to ſmoke againſt the Land; which, after the Defeat at <hi>Dunbar</hi> and at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> was brought in ſubjection to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for ſeveral years. So in proceſs of time, calling to mind how the Malignants, again recovering power and reſtored to the Government, were ſuffered peaceably at their own pleaſure and leaſure to overturn the Glorious Work of our <hi>Covenanted Reformation,</hi> and to cut down the carved work of the Houſe of our GOD, as it were with Axes and Hammers, by reſcinding all the Acts and Laws made in ſavours thereof, and to reintroduce the abjured yokes of <hi>Anti-chriſtian Prelacy, Eraſtian Supremacy,</hi> and <hi>Abſolute Tyranny;</hi> Which, through our ſinful and ſcandalous Complyance therewith, have been ſo far advanced, that there wanted little to the re-eſtabliſhment of Popery it ſelf in theſe Lands. Having it alſo in recent memory, what indignities have been done to our Covenants, in not only breaking them, and declaring them void and of no force, &amp; enacting the breaches of them, and abjuring of them, but in burning them, and making it a capital Crime to own them. Which horrid violations and villanies have been generally complyed with, or connived at without control. For which, we cannot but acknowledge and adore the Righteouſneſs of the LORD, in giving us up unto, and ſuffering us long to houl under many miſeries and calamities of graſſant Tyranny, Oppreſſion, Perſecution, and Murdering violence, theſe Eight and Twenty years: Whereby the Land hath been reduced almoſt to deſolation.</hi> And conſidering alſo, that a cloud of calamities do ſtill hang over our heads, and threaten us with ſad things to come, we cannot but look upon theſe things as from the Lord, who is righteous in all his wayes, feeding us with the bread of tears, and making us to drink the waters of affliction, until we be taught to know how evil and bitter a thing it is to depart away from him, by breaking the Oath and Covenant which we had made with Him, and that we may be humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before Him, by confeſſing of our ſin, and forſaking the evil of our way.</p>
            <p>Therefore being preſſed with ſo great neceſſities and ſtraits, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the word of God, and having the example of Gods People of old, who in the time of their troubles, and when they were to ſeek de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,

And remembring the practice of our Predeceſſors, in the year 1596. wherein the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> and all the Kirk Judicatories, with the concurrence of many of the Nobility, Gentry, and Burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, did with many tears acknowledge before God, the breach of the National Covenant, and engaged themſelves into a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even as our Predeceſſors and theirs had before done, in the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> and Convention of States, in the year 1567. <hi>And the more recent practice of the Godly renewing the <hi>National Covenant,</hi> and Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the breaches of it, both befote they obtained Authority for it, in the year 1638. And again by Authority, in the year 1639.

               </hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that this Duty, when gone about out of Conſcience, hath very often been attended with a reviving out of troubles, and with a Bleſſing and Succeſs from Heaven: We do humbly and ſincerely, as in His ſight who is the ſearcher of hearts, Acknowledge the many ſins, and great tranſgreſſions of the Land: We have done wickedly, our Kings, our Princes, our Nobles, our Judges, our Officers, our Teachers, and our People. Albeit the Lord hath long and clearly ſpoken unto us, we have not hearkned unto His voice: Albeit He hath followed us with tender mercies, we have not been allured to wait upon Him, and walk in His way: And thô He hath ſtricken us, yet we have not grieved: Nay, thô He hath conſumed us, we have refuſed to receive correction. We have not remembred to render unto the Lord according to His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and according to our Vows and Promiſes; But have gone away backward, by a continued courſe of backſliding. And have <hi>moſt ſinfully and ſhamefully</hi> broken <hi>the National Covenant, and</hi> all the Articles of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant, which <hi>our Fathers</hi> ſwore before God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men.</p>

We made little conſcience of conſtant endeavours to preſerve the Reformation, when we did not in ſeaſon teſtifie againſt thoſe audacious and Heaven-daring Attempts. When our Miniſters were by a wicked Edict ejected from their Charges, both they and the people too eaſily complyed with it.</hi> 
               <q>And albeit in the National Covenant we are obliged to defend this Reformation, and to labour by all means lawful to recover the Purity and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Goſpel, by forbearing the practiſes of all Novations introduced in the Worſhip of GOD; or approbation of the Corruptions of the Publick Government of the Kirk;</q> 
               <hi>Yet we gave all the approbation required by Law of the Novation, and corruption of Prelacy, by hearing the Prelatick Curates. We and our Teachers in a great meaſure complyed with, ſubmitted unto, and connived at the encroachments of the Supremacy and Abſolute Power, both in Accepting and Countenancing the former Indulgences, and the late Tolleration. We have taken, and ſubſcribed Oaths and Bonds, all which have been impoſed theſe Twenty Eight years, for preſſing Conformity with the preſent Eſtabliſhments of Church and State, have been contrary unto the Reformation we ſwore to preſerve: Some of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining us from all endeavours to preſerve it, as thoſe that renounced the Priviledge of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Arms: Some of them Abjuring the Covenants expreſly, and condemning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the ends of them, as Rebellion, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Teſt.</hi> We have <hi>Iſſachar</hi>-like, couched under all burdens, in maintaining and defending an Arbitrary Power, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Tyranny, wholly imployed and applied for the deſtruction of the Reformation, and paying ſuch Subſidies and Supplies as were declaredly impoſed for upholding of Tyrants U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations, and ſuppreſſing all endeavours to preſerve the Reformation. We have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly endeavoured to maintain the Doctrine of this Reformed Church: Many of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have in ſinful ſilence ſucceaſed from bearing witneſs to ſome perſecuted Truths, and from applying their Doctrine to the ſins and corruptions of the Times; Whereby many of the People have been overcome with ſnares, and left to ſeek and maintain other Principles to juſtifie their practices of complyance, or extravagance on the right and left hand, not conſiſtent with the Doctrines and Rules of the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Others of us have been ignorant of the Doctrines, not conſtant in confeſſing them before men, when called to

We have come ſhort in Real, Sincere and conſtant endeavours to preſerve the Worſhip of GOD, Publick and Private: Many of our Miniſters have left off Preaching, and the People hearing, in times of hazard: We have been negligent and remiſs in Family-Worſhip; And in ſtead of preſerving it, many of us have done much to diſcourage and hinder it, in ſome Families: And in ſecret Worſhip we have been Formal and careleſs.</hi> Many have ſatisfyed themſelves with the Purity of the Ordinances, neglecting the Power thereof; yea, ſome have turned aſide to crooked wayes, deſtructive to both. <hi>We have not been careful to preſerve the Diſcipline and Government, Church Cenſures being laid aſide, and not impartially exerciſed againſt Scandals Perſonal and publick: Scandalous perſons heing admitted to hold up their Children to Baptiſm, and to the Communion of the LORDS Table, and other priviledges of the Church, without reſpect to the Rules of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or conſtitution of this Church: And many of us have been untender in giving, in taking, and removing Offences, without obſerving the Rules and Order of Chriſt; And ſome inclining ſometimes to wayes tending either to the diſſolution of all Diſcipline, or Uſurpation of an Independent or Popular way of exerciſing it. And whereas, in the ſame firſt <hi>Article</hi> of the Solemn League, we are bound to <hi>endeavour the promoting and propagating of the Reformation, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in Religion, Confeſſion of Faith, Form of Church Government</hi> (which as it was primarly underſtood, ſo ſtill we owne to be only Presbyterial) <hi>Directory for Worſhip and Catechiſing;</hi> According to Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.46. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16.

Yet, alas! We have been ſo defective in this, that, upon the contrate, the Land hath been polluted again with Idolatrous <hi>Maſſes;</hi> Alters, and other Monuments have been ſuffered to be again erected; Penal Statutes have been ſo far from being executed againſt Papiſts, that they have been by Arbitrary and Abſolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſtopped, ſuſpended, and diſabled by the Toleration, in its own nature tending, and in its deſign intended to introduce Popery and Slavery; Yet this hath been accepted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed for, by many Miniſters, and countenanced, complyed; and concurred with, by many People, without a Teſtimony; or endeavour to withſtand it. Yea the Adminiſtration of the Government, &amp; greateſt Offices of Power and Truſt, hath been committed to, &amp; permitted to abide in the hands of Papiſts: And the Head of them, &amp; great Pillar &amp; Promoter of Popery, <hi>James</hi> the 7th. hath been owned as King contrary to the Laws of God and Man, which inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate him; And Covenant obligations; without reſpect of perſons, to extirpate Papiſts. And all of us have had too little Zeal or Indignation againſt, or fear of the manifeſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the coming in of Popery, and intended Eſtabliſhment of it in the Land; And little ſerious Wreſtling for the ruine and fall of Babylon, and that the Lord would divide and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Builders and Supporters thereof. Many, on the contrary, have prayed for Bleſſings to the Perſon and Government of a Papiſt on the Throne, the chiefeſt Supporter of it in theſe Lands. In like manner, We were bound "<hi>To endeavour the Extirpation of</hi> Prelacy, <hi>that is, Church Government by Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, their Chancellours, and Commiſſaries, Deans, Deans &amp; Chapters, Arch deacons and all other Eccleſiaſtical Officers, depending on that Hierarchy;</hi> As in the National Couenant,</hi>

               <hi>Which Article concerning Prelacy, being referred to the General Aſſembly, was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and declared Unlawful, as being clearly condemned in the Word of God. <hi>Math.</hi> 20.25.26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.25, 26. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17.28, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. Yet we have been ſo far from paying theſe our Vows, that Prelacy hath been by wicked Law eſtabliſhed, and in ſtead of Extirpation, hath been ſubmitted unto, and complied with by us; And in evidence thereof, as it was required by wicked and Arbitrary Laws, we heard, and received Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances diſpenſed by the intruding Curats, and payed them Stipends and Emoluments, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for upholding that which we were bound to extirpate. And not only ſo, but many did bind and oblige themſelves, by Subſcription, Promiſe, or Oath, to be ordinary Church-members of the Prelatical Church: And all of us, even thô we did ſtand at a diſtance from, and witneſſed againſt that Faction; yet we became very remiſs in our Zeal, and flack in our Prayers againſt Prelacy. Inſtead of endeavours to extirpate <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> as we are bound by the ſame Article of the Solemn League, and by the National Covenant,</hi> 
               <q>to deteſt all Superſtitions and Hereſies, without, or againſt the Word of God, and Doctrine of this reformed Kirk;</q>

Yet the body of the Land did not make conſcience of endeavouring the recovery of theſe Rights and Priviledges ſo perverted and polluted. Whence nothing could flow from theſe Fountains ſo poyſoned, but injuſtice and oppreſſion; And in ſtupid ſubmiſſion did own theſe for their Repreſentatives who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed their Liberties, and made Laws to enſlave the Nation, and entail Slaverie on the Poſterity.

But as our Fathers in their acknowledgement had reaſon to ſay,</hi> Neither hath it been our care to avoid theſe things which might harden the King in his evil way; But upon the Contrary, he hath not only been permitted, but many of us have been Inſtrumental to make him exerciſe his Power in many things tending to the prejudice of Religion and of the Covenant, and of the Peace and Safety of theſe Kingdoms; Which is ſo far from the right way of preſerving his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Perſon and Authority, that it cannot but provoke the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, unto the hazard of both; Nay, under a pretence of reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and doing for the King, whilſt he refuſes to do what was neceſſary for the Houſe of God, ſome have ranverſed and violated moſt of all the Articles of the Covenant. <hi>So, in our unhappy dayes, it is our Sin, Shame and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that we have had to do with men mounted on a Throne of iniquity, that have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Religion and Perſecuting it, deſigning to introduce Poperie it ſelf, and Slaverie, Deſtroying our Liberties, Suppreſſing the Evangel, and Oppreſſing its Profeſſors, Enacting and Executing manifeſt Injuſtice, ſtoping the Miniſtration of Juſtice againſt Idolaters, Adulterers, Murderers, and other Malifactors, and and puniſhing Equity and Duty inſtead of Iniquity, arrogating and obtaining a Monſtrous Prerogative above all Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, all Laws. all Liberties, a power to Tyrannize as be liſts without control. But, as it was our Fathers ſin to inaugurate the late King, after ſuch diſcoveries of his Hypocritical emnity to Religion and Liberty, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſubſcription of the Covenant; So, when he burnt and buried that Covenant, and degenerate into manifeſt Tyrannie, and had razed the very foundation upon which both his Right to govern, and the Peoples Allegiance were founded, and remitted the Subjects Allegiance by annulling the Bond of it; We ſinned in continuing ſtill to own his Authority, when oppoſite to and deſtructive of Religion and Liberty. And many in ſwearing the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> (including alſo the <hi>Supremacy</hi> with the boundleſs <hi>Prerogatives</hi>) without any Reſtrictions or Qualifications, when all the Authority he had was engaged and exerted in a Rebellion againſt GOD, forgetting, foregoing and diſowning theſe Limitations in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; And in putting in his Intereſt (with the Application of the words of the Covenant
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108660:31"/> to him, thô ſtated in oppoſition to it) in the ſtate of the quarrel, in our <hi>Declarations</hi> of war at <hi>Pentland</hi> and <hi>Bothuel-Bridge,</hi> for which the LORD put us to ſhame, and went not out with our Armies. Again we deſire to confeſs and mourn over this as the ſin of the Land, and breach of Covenant, that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> hath been admitted to the exerciſe of the Royal Office, againſt the Laws of GOD and man, being incapable of the Covenants qualifications of a Magiſtrate, and, being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> incapable of taking the Oath of <hi>Coronation,</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the True <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and aboliſh and gainſtand <hi>Popery;</hi> which, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>true Religion,</hi> Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, is ſtatute by the 8 <hi>Act Parl:</hi> 1: <hi>K: Jam:</hi> 6: That all Kings at the Reception of their Princely Authority, ſhall take and ſwear.

            <p>Our own Conſciences within, and <hi>Gods</hi> Judgements upon us without, do convince us of the manifold wilful renewed Breaches of the <hi>Fourth Article,</hi> which concerneth the diſcovery of Malignants; <hi>conſonant to the Scriptures; 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 23:6: <hi>Eſther</hi> 7:5, 6: <hi>Pſal:</hi> 26:5, 6: <hi>Pſal:</hi> 101:8: <hi>Prov:</hi> 25:5: For their</hi> Crimes have not only been connived at, but diſpenſed with and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and themſelves received into intimate Fellowſhip— and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with— Counſels, admitted into—Parliaments, and put in places of Power and Authority for managing the publick Affairs of the Kingdom, whereby in <hi>Gods</hi> Juſtice, they got at laſt into their hands the whole power and Strength of the Kingdom, both in Judicatories and Armies; and did imploy the ſame unto the enacting and proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unlawful Engagement in War againſt the Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> Notwithſtanding of the diſcent of many conſiderable Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who had given conſtant proof of their integrity in the Cauſe, from the beginning; Of many faithful Teſtimonies, and free Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Servants of <hi>God;</hi> of the Supplications of many <hi>Synods, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries</hi> and <hi>Shires;</hi> And the Declarations of the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> and their Commiſſioners to the Contrary; Which Engagement, as it was the Cauſe of much Sin, ſo alſo of much Miſerie and Calamity unto this Land, and held forth the grieveouſneſs of our ſin in Complying with Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, in the greatneſs of our Judgement, that we may be taught never to ſplit again upon the ſame Rock, upon which the Lord hath ſet ſo Remarkable a beacon. And after all that is come to paſs unto us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this our treſpaſs; And after that Grace hath been ſhewed unto <hi>our Fathers, and us. once and again,</hi> from the Lord our God, by breaking theſe Mens Yoke from off <hi>their, and</hi> our necks, <hi>and ſometimes delivering our Fathers ſo far from their inſultings, that</hi> He put them into a Capacity to Act for the good of Religion, <hi>their</hi> own ſafety, and the Peace and ſafety of the Kingdom, ſhould <hi>they and</hi> we again break his Commandment and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108660:32"/> by joyning once more with the People of theſe Abominations and taking into our boſome thoſe Serpents, which had formerly ſtung us almoſt unto death. This, as it would argue great madneſs and folly upon our part; So, no doubt, if it be not avoided, will provoke the Lord againſt us to Conſume us, until there be no remnant, nor eſcaping in the Land. <hi>Many times have we been warned of the Sin of Complyance with Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, both by faithful Inſtructions, and fatherly Corrections from the Lord; Yet after all theſe Puniſhments, and after all theſe Mercies, in mitigating theſe Puniſhments, We have again joyned with the People of theſe Abominations. <hi>The Lord is Righteous, for we remain yet eſcaped, as it is this day: Behold we are before Him in our Treſpaſſes, and we cannot ſtand before Him, becauſe of this.</hi> Theſe Incendiaries, Malignants, and evil Inſtruments, made many grievous Encroachments, and prevailed much in the dayes of our Fathers; But not without diſſent, Teſtimonies, Warnings, and Declarations to the Contrary: But, in our unhappy dayes, they have been ſuffered, yea encouraged, without any ſignificant joynt Teſtimony, not only to hinder the Reformation of Religion, but to overturn the whole Work of Reformation, to Burn and Bury the Covenants for it, to re-eſtabliſh abjured Prelacy: erect a monſtrous, Chriſt-exauctorating, and Church-enſlaving Supremacy, attempt the introduction of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery at the gate of an Antichriſtian Tolleration, and to perſecute and deſtroy the Godly, who durſt not in conſcience comply with them. <hi>And not only to divide the King from his People, or one of the Kingdoms from another,</hi> but, firſt to divide the bulk and body of both Kingdoms, and make them purſue divided Intereſts, from the Intereſt and Cauſe of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> And then to divide the remnant, of ſuch as adhered to it, among themſelves, by <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and other bones of contention, in order to get them more eaſily deſtroyed; And at length, to engage the King into ſuch a diviſion from the People, as to make him, in ſtead of their Protector, their declared Deſtroyer: And, not only <hi>to make parties among the People,</hi> contrary to this League and Covenant, but to draw and divide the whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to party with their perjuries.

Both Kingdoms are mutually guilty of diſſolving this Covenanted Union, in Invading each other, at ſeveral times, contrary to the Covenant: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, in ſubjecting us to their Conqueſt, and forcing us to a ſubmiſſion and Union with their <hi>Sectarian</hi> Uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urpations, on Church and State: And this Nation, in giving ſuch provocations to them, by the Unlawful Engagement, in the year 1648: By treating with ſetting up, and entertaining the Head of the Malignant party, their Enemy and ours both, as our King, in the year 1650; And inwading them upon his quarrel, in the <hi>Worceſter</hi> expedition, <hi>Anno</hi> 1651. Since which time, after that Kingdom and this both united in that unhappy courſe of reſtoring the King, without reſpect to the Covenant; And re-eſtabliſhing Prelacy, which broke our Covenanted Union and Conjunction, That Nation hath ſometimes ſent aid to our Perſecutors, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing our Attempts to recover our Religion and Liberties; And this Nation hath ſent Forces to help their Deſtroyers, and to ſuppreſs their Endeavours for the recovery of their Priviledges. And in the mean time, we have been very litle ſolicitons for Correſpondence to ſettle Union with ſuch of them as owned the Covenant; Or, for giving to, or receiving from them, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Informations of our reſpective caſes and conditions, under all our Calamities and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies caſt upon us: Nor have we ſtudied to keep up Sympathie, or Communion of Saints, or a mutual bearing of one anothers burdens, as became Covenanted Brethren. On the other hand, in ſtead of Union in Truth and Duty, according to the Bond of the Covenant, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy hath been ſtudied, in defection from the Covenant: And an Union and Peace, which wanted the foundation laid down in the foregoing Articles of the Covenant, to wit, Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government, againſt <hi>Popery, Prelacy, Schiſm,</hi> or <hi>Sectarianiſm,</hi> for our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, and the diſcovering, ſuppreſſing and puniſhing the enemies of theſe Intereſts.

               <hi>A duty very clear in the Scriptures, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.23. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1, 18. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.11.12. But alas!

There hath been great murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repining becauſe of expence of means, and pains in doing of our duty. <hi>And not only ſo, but many have Sworn and Subſcribed Oaths and Bonds engaging againſt ſuch aſſiſtances very directly, and to condemn all ſuch endeavours to aſſiſt, defend, or reſcue them, as <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion;</hi> And obliging them to aſſiſt their murdering Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Enemies by ſuch concurrences as they required: Yea, many inſtead of coming out to the help of the Lord againſt the Mighty, and defending their Brethren, have come out to the help of the Mighty againſt the Lord, His Cauſe, Covenant and oppreſſed People, concurring in Armes againſt them at all the Appearances that have been aſtayed for the cauſe of Chriſt; Appearing at Courts, held for informing againſt, and Condemning their Brethren that were Preſent at, or concerned in ſuch Appearances for the Covenanted Cauſe; And coming in as Witneſſes againſt them; Sitting in Aſſyſes for Condemning them; And guarding them to their Executions, when Martyred for their Duty and the Intereſt of Truth. Many again have denied to Reſet, Harbour, and Entertain their Brethren, Perſecuted for maintaining the Covenanted Reformation; And ſome have raiſed the <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry</hi> after them, thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning and aſſiſting in the cruel Murder of ſeveral faithful Brethren. The moſt part have owned the Great Murderer, who authorized all the reſt and enacted all theſe Murders; And aſſiſted him and his Complices and Executioners of his murdering Mandats, with their Purſes and Eſtates, in paying the Supplies profeſſedly demanded, and declaredly impoſed for enabl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to accompliſh theſe Miſchiefs. Yea, many of our Brethren have been ſo far from aſſiſting that they have added affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But alas! It is long ſince our Fathers had reaſon to complain and confeſs, that</hi> many <hi>in their day</hi> by perſwaſion or terror ſuffered themſelves to be divided and withdrawn to make defection to the contrary part: Many had turned
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108660:33"/> off to a deteſtable indefferency and Neutrality in this Cauſe which ſo much concerneth the Glory of God, and the good of theſe Kingdoms; Nay many had made it their ſtudy to walk ſo as they might comply with all times, and all the revolutions thereof. It was not their care to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, encourage, intruſt, and employ ſuch only, as from their hearts did affect and mind Gods work: But the hearts of ſuch many times had been diſcouraged, and their hands weakned, their ſufferings neglected, and themſelves ſlighted; And many who <hi>had been</hi> once open Enemies, and alwayes ſecret Underminers, countenanced and employed; Nay, even thoſe who had been looked upon as Incendiaries, and upon whom the Lord had ſet Marks of deſperate Malignancy, Falſhood and Deceit, were brought in as fit to manage publick Affairs. <hi>All which Sins and Breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Covenant have now encreaſſed to a greater height of heinouſneſs; For in our day, theſe Incendiaries, deſperate and ingrained Malignants, have only been imployed in, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the management of Affairs in Church and State, and none but they have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Habile</hi> by Law: And ſuch diviſions from this Covenanted Conjunction, and defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the contrary part, have been enacted and eſtabliſhed by Law. Yea, all the unhappy diviſions that have been in our day, have been the woeful conſequents and effects of Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the contrary part. At the firſt erection of Prelacy, many, both Miniſters and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, partly by Terror and partly by Perſwaſion. did withdraw from this Covenanted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and make defection unto Prelacy, with which they combin'd in conforming with it, and ſubmitting unto the Miniſtry of the conforming Curats: And afterwards, by the terror of the fear of Men, and the perſwaſions of their Counſels and Example, many of us have been ſeduced into a Combination with Malignants, in taking Oaths and Bonds contrary to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, thereby dividing our ſelves from the Recuſants, and making defection to the party impoſing them, and oppoſing the Covenants. And by Combination of thoſe that preferred Peace to Truth, and Eaſe to Duty, by the terror of threatned continuance of Perſecution, and the perſwaſion of a promiſed Relaxation and immunity from Troubles, many Miniſters have been divided from the Teſtimony of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Supremacy and Abſolute Power, and one from another, and have made defection to that part and Party that were advancing theſe Encroachments and Uſurpations on the prerogatives of Chriſt and Priviledges of his Church, by receiving <hi>Indulgences</hi> and <hi>Tolerations</hi> from them; in their own nature deſtructive unto, and given, and received on terms incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Duties of the Covenants, which were contrived and conferred on purpoſe to divide them from this cauſe, and from their Brethren that more tenaciouſly adhered to it, and did effectuate that deſign in a great meaſure. And others gave themſelves to a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable indifference, in complying with, conniving at, and not witneſſing againſt theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but paſſing them over in a ſecure and ſubmiſſive ſilence: And yet many of us have not ſhewed our diſlike of theſe backſliding courſes, by diſcountenancing, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from, and keeping our ſelves free of all participation with them: And others have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, that have not mourned for the ſin of theſe things, to the irritation and offence, rather than conviction of theſe they withdrew from.

Yea, both in time of our greateſt Sufferings, and ſince we got this Liberty of date, we muſt acknowledge with regrate, that Idleneſs of both kinds, hath too much abounded among us: Both that when we were in a manner driven from the World, and ſhut up from all Employments, but the exerciſe of Godlineſs, many did not improve that opportunity of the Croſs to promote ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and communion with God, being ſlothful in Prayer, Reading, and other Duties:
